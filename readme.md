Intro
=====

This is a collection of my dotfiles. I swap systems often (usually between pop-OS and manjaro), so
this is streamlined for those distros. I have quit ricing. I got too caught up in details that just
get in the way of doing things. There are better hobbies to have.  My dotfiles are now written with
a minimalist approach in mind.

This dotfile handles my:

- rudimentary/common software
- bioinformatic software
- emacs
- some fonts
- tweaks
- zsh


Installation Notes
==================
## Warning

The following has not been fully automated:

**In Terminal**
- Installation of *oh-my-zsh*

## Notes on usage:

- emacs: run '/scripts/setup-emacs-TagOS.sh'
- bioinformatic software: run '/scripts/setup-bioinformatics-tools.sh'
- zsh: run '/scripts/setup-zsh-TagOS.sh'
- To setup architecture (rudimentary/common software, some fonts, tweaks) for either debian or arch based, run the appropiate file in '/architecture-handlers'
- Programming languages are set up through scripts under '/programming-languages/

## setup

emacs is not an OS, but I do use it as an interface.
