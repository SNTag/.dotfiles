#+TITLE: $1-$2 month journal

* Vitals
** Focus items
Topics and reminders I would like to spend a few minutes on during every
morning review: High value time, always be compounding, always be in a focus
block, etc.
** Tired list
A general list of valuable activities for when I have some time, but brain too
tired to come up with anything.
** Planning / overview / major done list
Check lists with books, courses, etc.
* Projects
A list of current major projects, with links to each project's dedicated org
file.
* Tasks
A list of Org mode tasks that are not associated with specific projects. This
list is reviewed at the start of every month, as I have to manually copy across
those tasks that are still relevant and important.
